    <h2>🐾 Every Dog Deserves a Path to Thrive</h2>
    <p>
      At Doggy Dev, we believe that every dog—regardless of age, ability, or background—deserves care, enrichment, and a chance to grow. From day one, we treat your dog like family. Whether they’re bounding with energy or navigating life with special needs, we tailor every experience to their unique personality and goals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our services go beyond walks and training. We offer group enrichment activities that build confidence and social skills, personalized one-on-one sessions for behavior and development, and even field trips and car rides that add joy and stimulation to your dog’s routine.
    </p>
    <p>
      We specialize in working with blind, deaf, neurologically diverse, and mobility-impaired dogs—because we know that every dog has something to gain, and every dog has something to give.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doggy Dev isn’t just a service—it’s a commitment to your dog’s quality of life. Let’s build something beautiful together.
