  <h1>About Doggy Dev</h1>

  <div class="about-section">
    <h2>🐾 Built from Experience, Fueled by Heart</h2>
    <p>
      Doggy Dev was founded by a lifelong animal advocate with over 4 years of hands-on experience at Stray Rescue of St. Louis, specializing in care for dogs with disabilities. That foundation shaped everything we do—from how we train, to how we listen, to how we build trust with every dog and every human.
    </p>
    <p>
      We believe that dogs aren’t just pets—they’re partners, teachers, and family. Our founder’s background in special needs care, enrichment design, and behavior support means we meet each dog where they are, and help them grow from there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doggy Dev is more than a business—it’s a mission. We’re here to elevate the lives of dogs and their humans through thoughtful service, creative problem-solving, and a whole lot of tail wags.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether your dog is blind, deaf, neurodivergent, or just needs a little extra love, we’re ready to help them thrive.
